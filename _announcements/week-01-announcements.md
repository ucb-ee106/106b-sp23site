title: Week 1 - Welcome to EECS C106B/206B!

We're extremely excited to have you! It's going to be a great semester. We've spent a lot of time revamping the content, and we hope you will gain a lot out of this advanced robotics course. 106B/206B really pushes the envelope by diving into open research problems, building off the foundation established by 106A/206A. 

**This week:**
- Homework 1 released (due 1/24)
- [Project 1A released (due 1/31)](https://ucb-ee106.github.io/106b-sp23site/assets/proj/proj1a.pdf)
- Discussion 1
- Assessment due Friday 1/20 (if you haven't taken 106A/206A)
- [Optional Project 0](https://ucb-ee106.github.io/106b-sp23site/assets/proj/proj0.pdf)
